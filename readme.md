## Tables

### demo_user2

### user_flight

this table stores the basic information of user_flight

| Field | Type | Key | Nullable | Unique | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | char(36) | Yes | | Yes | primary key |
| user_id | char(36) | | Yes | | the id of user who takes this flight |
| flight_id | char(36) | | Yes | | the id of flight which is taken by a user |
| create_time | datetime | | | | the time that this row was inserted |
| ts | datetime | | | | the last time that created or modified this row |

### mongo_flight

this table stores the basic information of flight booking status

| Field | Type | Key | Nullable | Unique | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| flightId | char(36) | Yes | | Yes | primary key |
| capacity | char(36) | | Yes | | passengers capacity of this flight |
| available | char(36) | | Yes | | the remaining capacity of this flight |

## Logic

### flight
Before **inserting** a flight in record, back-end should check:
1. whether fligth_name and its depart time exist or not; ✔
2. whether all fields except note are not null and valid. ✔

### user
Before **inserting** an user in record, back-end should check:
1. whether username and email address exist or not; ✔
2. whether all fields except note are not null and valid. ✔

### user_flight
Before **inserting** an user_fligth in record, back-end should check:
1. whether the user has booked that flight✔
2. whether all fields except note are not null and valid. ✔

### user_flight

## APIs

### flight
1. add flight
2. get flight by id
3. update flight by id
4. Search flight by departure, destination,start time, end time and order by price.

### user
1. add user
2. get user by id or email
3. update user by id
4. get user by idlist

### user_flight
1. add user_flight(connect user with a flight)
2. delete user_flight(disconnect user with a flight)
3. get all user_flights responses
